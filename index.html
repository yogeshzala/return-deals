        <h3>Closeout, Excess and Clearance Loads</h3>
        <p class="p">
          Loads called closeout, excess or clearance may contain new items,
          shelf-pulls, overstock merchandise, out of season, and liquidated
          merchandise. Most of this merchandise is in perfect condition – with
          tags and labels.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Salvage Loads</h3>
        <p class="p">
          Salvage Merchandise loads are made up of a variety of products which
          are being sold in bulk at a small percentage of retail or wholesale
          pricing, or items which can no longer be sold at their regular retail
          prices. Specific reasons the salvage merchandise items may have been
          returned include: in-store display, out of box/damaged box, cosmetic
          blemishes or slight defect, buyer remorse, missing product components,
          defective, out of season, etc.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Merchandise – Working and Marketable</h3>
        <p class="p">
          Most items are salvage/returns (unless stated otherwise they are
          working and marketable). Returns may be damaged. The amount of damage
          may vary from load to load. You should expect to receive damaged items
          in loads of customer returned merchandise. Return Deals prides itself
          on high quality merchandise and exceptional customer service. Please
          contact us if you have any questions regarding the types of
          merchandise we offer.

        <h3>Product Promotion</h3>
        <p class="p">
          You may NOT use the stores’ names or names of any of the store brands
          in your advertising, or in the selling and representation of their
          products.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Freight Charges</h3>
        <p class="p">

          calculated using origination and destination zip codes. We have strong
          relationships with many freight carriers in order to offer you the
          best freight rate. If you are interested in handling your own freight,
          please let us know.
